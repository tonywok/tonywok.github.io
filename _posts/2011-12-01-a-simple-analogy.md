Up until this point I’ve been posting almost entirely about programming. I have no doubt this will continue, but here’s an interesting little thought nugget I had recently that I’d like to share.

> A friend and I were talking about how we often perceive ourselves living in a three dimensional world, despite time offering a fourth, often neglected, dimension of our known existence. It occurred to me just how little we consider it when I was at my girlfriend’s house for Thanksgiving. At one point her niece (age 4 or so) said, “Mom, that was a long time ago!”. She was instantly corrected by her Mother saying: “No, that wasn’t a long time ago, it was only 2 days ago”. I, along with everyone else, thought nothing of it.

It’s so easy to neglect time and live in the moment, responding to everything from our current frame of reference. In a recent discussion, a friend and I conceptualized time as a blurred motion that follows someone as they move through three dimensional space. Of course, we don’t see this blurred line in our day to day life, but we are able to conceptualize it based on photos, videos, and simply observing things move from point A to point B.

Later that week, I had a realization - a pretty obvious one in hindsight. To my girlfriend’s niece, it was a long time ago, given the amount of time she’s been aware and around to compare it to.

I think this little example offers an even better way to conceptualize time as a dimension.
