1. Born Ruffians - I need a life
1. White Rabbits - Kid on my shoulders
1. Death from above 1979 - Romantic Rights
1. Delta Spirit - Bushwick Blues
1. Drink Up Buttercup - Seasickness Pills
1. Menomena - Muscle'n flo
1. The Morning Benders - Loose change
1. Of Montreal - An Eluardian Instance
1. Plants and Animals - Feedback in the field
1. The Rural Alberta Advantage - Drain the Blood
1. The Subjects - Goldshire Boogie
1. The Thermals - Power doesn’t run on nothing
1. Neutral Milk Hotel - Engine

Tune into my twitter/facebook feeds for the announcement on when you can tune in to hear my dorky voice on FM radio!

**Update:**

I ended up switching up my list a little bit due to lengths of songs and profanity. I think I like this one better anywho. Big thanks to CD101, I had a wonderful time.
